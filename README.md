Aurion is an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) developed by [Auriga](https://www.auriga.fr/) used by the students of ISEN (Higher Institute for Electronics and Digital Training) to access their plannings, scores and some more information.

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. The API makes it easier to send data
between devices and applications.

Many students can testify that Aurion is not ergonomic enough and as such some took the initiative to make it better. [Scorpion](https://github.com/LiamAbyss/Scorpion) coded in Java, [PyAurion](https://github.com/MylowMntr/PyAurion) in Python, [Aurion-Planning_to_ICS](https://github.com/Victor-Loos/Aurion-Planning_to_ICS) also in Python, [Api Aurion](https://github.com/nicolegrimpeur/apiAurion) in Javascript are some of the numerous projects undertaken by students.

I too took time to make it better with this. The benefit of this API is firstly the fact it is developed in [dart](https://dart.dev/), the base language of [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) which is used to make apps for any screen and device.
